## Artificial Neural Network in GO

A simple 3-layer ANN written in go.
I am using my own matrix structures and Dot product algorithms so there might be a little room for enhancements there.

See the example/ folder to see an example of solving the MNIST data set at 96% accuracy.
When you add a couple more epochs you can get to 98% accuracy.
